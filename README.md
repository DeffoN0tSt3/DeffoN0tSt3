Hello World! I'm Steve, also known as n0tst3, an independent security researcher and analyst from Scotland, UK.

I've had an avid interest in Computers and all-things Tech since my early teens.

Throughout my security research, I've assisted Governments, Individuals, and Organizations throughout the world, including the US DOJ, NHS UK, GOV UK, and many more. I'm mostly self-taught, but that wouldn't be the case if there was no internet! phew!

My passion for Computers and Technology started during my early teens, and 20 years on, it has become a whole' lot more complicated.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to assist Governments, Individuals, and Organizations worldwide in my security research work, including prominent bodies such as the US DOJ, NHS UK, and GOV UK, among others. While mostly self-taught, I'm grateful for the internet, which has played an essential role in my learning journey.

<summary><strong>A Little More About Me?</strong></summary>
Nice! you want to know more.. Sure..

I struggle with social anxiety and ADD. But worry not, these ingredients only add to the delightful concoction that I am!

Diving into the digital realm, I transform into a theatrical multitasker who moonlights as a chronic tab hoarder, thanks to my ADD superpowers. Toggling between projects and infosec memes has never been more seamless. After all, who needs focus when you've got the power of distraction on your side?

When my social anxiety sprouts its leafy head, you'll find me retreating to the enchanted forest of forums, where I bravely slay bugs and help fellow nerds navigate the treacherous terrain of code. Yes, I use various aliases online. Anonymity is my cloak kinda, and empathy is my sword, as I make the digital realm a safer place for all, one step at a time!

Did I mention I have a huge love for everything Infosec?

I'm quite the infosec enthusiast, I don't think there is much more rewarding than unearthing vulnerabilities and deciphering the cryptic language of cyber threats to fortify digital fortresses! I indulge in research papers/write-ups, sharpening my skills in static, dynamic code analysis. Malware samples? Sure, let's dissect/reverse that crap.. Honey üçØ Honey üçØ

But, how did it all start?
Around 2002-3 üï∞Ô∏è, I dove into the mystic world of programming, starting with C++ on my Windows relic, wrestling dependencies and compilations. I quickly ventured into Perl, then PHP, and became an IRC skid.. Quite the contrast .
